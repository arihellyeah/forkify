# Forkify

This Javascript project will allow the user to search for recipes, add ingredients to their shopping list, and add recipies to their "likes".
It imports recipes from a recipies API and retains user data in localStorage.

### Prerequisites

For this app, you will need to have Node and NPM on your system:
Fire command prompt and run command:
```
$ node -v
```

Make sure NPM is installed
```
$ npm -v
```
If you see versions for both, then you are good to go! If not, [follow this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
